    <div class="container">
        <div id="line1">
            <li> <strong> Stay Hydrated: </strong> Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout sessions
                to maintain hydration
                levels and support optimal bodily functions.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="line2">
            <li><strong>Balanced Nutrition: </strong> Fuel your body with a balanced diet rich in lean proteins, complex
                carbohydrates,
                healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Ensure you're consuming enough calories to support your energy
                expenditure and muscle recovery needs.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="line3">
            <li> <strong> Nutrition:</strong>"Balanced nutrition is essential for overall health, providing vital
                nutrients for energy, growth, and disease prevention."</li>
        </div>
        <div id="line4">
            <li><strong> Warm-Up and Cool Down:</strong> Always start your workout with a proper warm-up to prepare your
                muscles and
                cardiovascular system for exercise. Likewise, finish with a cool down to gradually lower your heart rate
                and
                prevent post-exercise soreness.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="line5">
            <li><strong> Proper Form: </strong> Focus on maintaining proper form and technique during exercises to
                minimize the risk of
                injuries. If you're unsure about a particular exercise, consider seeking guidance from a fitness
                instructor.
            </li>
        </div>
        <div id="line6">
            <li><strong>Progressive Overload:</strong> Gradually increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of your
                workouts to
                continually challenge your body and promote strength gains. However, avoid overtraining and listen to
                your
                body's signals to prevent burnout and injury.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="line7">
            <li><strong>Rest and Recovery:</strong> Incorporate rest days into your workout routine to allow your
                muscles time to repair
                and
                grow stronger. Adequate sleep is also crucial for recovery, so aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per
                night.
            </li>
        </div>
        <div id="line8">
            <li><strong>Mindful Breathing:</strong> Pay attention to your breathing patterns during workouts, ensuring
                you're inhaling
                and
                exhaling properly to optimize oxygen delivery to your muscles and support performance.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="line9">
            <li><strong>Stay Consistent:</strong> Consistency is key to seeing results. Set realistic goals and stick to
                your workout
                schedule, making exercise a regular part of your routine.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="line10">
            <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Learn to differentiate between discomfort and pain. If you
                experience sharp or
                persistent pain during exercise, stop immediately and seek medical attention if needed.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="line11">
            <li><strong>Variety and Cross-Training:</strong>Incorporate a variety of exercises into your routine to
                target different
                muscle groups and prevent boredom. Consider cross-training activities like cycling, swimming, or yoga to
                improve overall fitness and prevent overuse injuries.</li>
